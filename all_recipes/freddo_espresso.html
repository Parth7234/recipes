    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Freddo Espresso, a quintessential Greek summer coffee, is a masterclass in transforming a hot brew into an intensely refreshing and elegant cold beverage. The process begins with a freshly prepared, hot double shot of high-quality espresso, into which sugar can be instantly dissolved for a smooth, integrated sweetness. This hot mixture is then immediately combined with a couple of ice cubes and vigorously agitated in a drink mixer or cocktail shaker. This crucial, violent chilling action doesn't just cool the coffee; it whips it into a thick, stable, and aromatic light-brown foam. To serve, a tall glass is filled with fresh, solid ice cubes, and the frothy, chilled espresso is poured over the top, creating a beautiful layered effect. The result is a powerful, undiluted coffee experience where the dense crema sits atop the ice-cold liquid, delivering a potent and invigorating caffeine kick that is the ultimate antidote to the midday heat.</p>
