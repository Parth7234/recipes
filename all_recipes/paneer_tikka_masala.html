    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creating the perfect Paneer Tikka Masala involves a delightful two-part process. First, cubes of fresh paneer are marinated in a thick blend of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and a symphony of spices like turmeric, red chili powder, and garam masala. These marinated cubes are then pan-fried, grilled, or baked until they are beautifully golden and slightly charred at the edges. Simultaneously, a luscious gravy is prepared by sautéing a base of pureed onions and tomatoes with aromatics until fragrant. A medley of spices is then added and cooked until the oil separates, after which a rich paste of cashews or a splash of cream is stirred in to create a velvety smooth texture, often finished with a touch of crushed kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). Finally, the charred paneer tikka pieces are gently folded into this vibrant, creamy gravy, simmered for a few minutes to absorb the flavors, and garnished with fresh coriander for a restaurant-worthy finish.</p>
